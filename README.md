# SF Crime Incidents

Analysed datasf.gov dataset to pull information on crimes by district. 

# The Issue

San Francisco is one of top tourist attractions in world but like many major cities it has its own challenges with crime.  

For this reason, we decided to do this project to help increase awareness about the safety of San Francisco neighborhoods.

# Conclusion

- Aimed to enhance public awareness regarding the safety of San Francisco neighborhoods, particularly for tourists.
- Discovered that violent crimes were predominantly localized in certain areas, mostly away from tourist spots.
- Identified the Tenderloin district as having the highest number of crimes, significantly higher than other districts.
- Highlighted car break-ins and theft as the crimes most likely to affect tourists, suggesting potential preventive measures.
- Concluded that San Francisco's overall safety is comparable to other major cities, debunking misconceptions about its danger level.
- Utilized a blend of web and data technologies, including JavaScript, D3.js for data visualization, Flask for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.
